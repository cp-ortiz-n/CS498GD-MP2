In order to access the game level for MP2 once you have downloaded the project open up MP2.uproject. From there, in the Contents
folder, you will see a folder named "MP2", which is where a large part of the assets and blueprints I used for this game level
were stored. If you open that "MP2" folder you will then open up the Maps folder and see a file named "MP2_Map.umap" and this is
where I created my game level for MP2, the new game mechanic, enemies, and everything else from the specs is in this map.

In order to access the game level for MP2 once you have downloaded the project open up MP2.uproject. From there, in the Contents folder, you will see a folder named "MP2", which is where a large part of the assets and blueprints I used for this game level were stored. If you open that "MP2" folder you will then open up the Maps folder and see a file named "MP2_Map.umap" and this is where I created my game level for MP2, the new game mechanic, enemies, and ever thing else from the specs is in this map. 

Game Level Goal: In this game you will be collecting all of the coins in the map in order to complete the level. The coins are all scattered throughout the world, so try to find them all! 

New Game Mechanic: Double Jump (Spacebar twice)

Updated Mechanic: Flight (Press 'F' to fly, and you can now fly whenever, no need to first land before taking flight again!

New Enemy: Turret (This enemy will continously shoot projectiles are you from across the map, always keeping track of you! Try your best to either destroy the turret, or keep collecting the coins while evading its projectiles! Nowhere is safe as these projectiles can go through walls! *Inspired by Minecraft's Vex mob*)
